# Java Programing Terms
## We will be addingto this as we go through the course. This will help you understnd common programming terms along with hava specific ones.

#### Basic Syntax and Coding Conventions
**Case Sensitivity** - Java is case-sensitive, which means Hello and hello hsve differnt meanigs. 
**Class NamClasses** - All class names should use Pascal Case (Upper Camel Case). This means the first letter of each word that makes up the class should be Camel Case (Lower Camel Case). This means the first letter of the first word is lower case and each word after is capitalized.
**Program File Name** - The name of the program file should match the class name.
**Main Method** - Java applications begin from the main method. this method is executed when you run the application. you can however have more than one main method, but only one of the can be targeted to run at a time.
#### Lesson 3
**class** - a blueprint or object for creating other object. It describes what the object knows (state) and what it does (behavior). Objects are immutable.
**constructor** - A constructor is a special method used in a class for the instantation process. A constructor has no return type and is automatically called is it is not defined in a class.
**method** - A behavior that belongs to a class, that allows a set of statements to be excuted together as a block. This behavior is only executed when the method is called. 
**comments** - this type of statement is ignored by the compiler when you execute a program. They are used in various ways, such as preventing the execution of code, or providing documentation.
